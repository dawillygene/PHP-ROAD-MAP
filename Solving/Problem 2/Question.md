The University of Dodoma through its College of Informatics and Virtual Education (CIVE) has decided to create a web system to manage the whole process of Industrial Practical Training (IPT). The system was developed using PHP and MySQL database. The system has two parts, which are source codes and database. The database part is hosted at the server with IP Address 192.168.10.10 and the source code is hosted at the server with IP Address 192.168.10.20. After the system has been deployed it was observed that the performance was poor as the system loads very slowly especially when the information are retrieved from the server. It was observed that the problem was due to huge amount of data that are loaded from the server. As an expert in web development, you have been consulted to give your advice. In your advice you suggested AJAX technology to be used to load data from the server to the client side so as to improve performance. Assume you want to load the following information from the table student (FName, SName, Program, Gender and RegNo). Write a script hosted at the source code server to show how you connect to the database, load data from the server using AJAX and display to the client in a table format. Use JQuery methods to send the AJAX requests.Use the following credentials to access the database server: Udom IPT as a database name, Password: 123_abc, username: udom_cive.
