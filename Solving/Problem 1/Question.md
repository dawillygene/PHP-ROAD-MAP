Write a PHP script that obtains a URL and its description from a user through html form and stores the information into a database using MySQL. Use URL and Urltable as the name of the database and table respectively. The first field of the table should contain an actual URL, and the second, which is named Description, should contain a description of the URL. Use www.udom.ac.tz as the first URL, and input UDOM as its description. The second URL should be www.ratiba.udom.ac.tz, and the description should be UDOM Time Table System. The third URL should be www.civeclassroom.udom.ac.tz, and its description should be CIVE digital classroom. The fourth URL should be www.civeipt.udom.ac.tz, and its description should be CIVE Industrial Practical Training. After each new URL is submitted, print the contents of the database in a table format.Use server side validation to make sure that the fields for URL and Description should accept empty values and should not contain spaces before and at the end.
